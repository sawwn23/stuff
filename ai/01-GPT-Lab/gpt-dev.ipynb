    "The attention mechanism, often called the \"attention node\" or layer in Transformers, lets the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, like words in a sentence, instead of treating them equally. It replaces older sequential processing in models like RNNs, enabling faster parallel computation and better handling of long-range dependencies. This core idea from the 2017 \"Attention is All You Need\" paper powers models like GPT and BERT. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMHkbXzHn7s)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "Imagine reading a sentence: \"The cat, which sat on the mat, ran away.\" When understanding \"ran,\" the model needs to know it refers to the cat, not the mat. Attention scores how much each word (like \"cat\") relates to others (like \"ran\"), weighting their influence dynamically. [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/self-attention-mechanism)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query, Key, Value\n",
    "Each input word turns into three vectors: Query (what I'm looking for), Key (what others offer), and Value (the actual info). For a word's query, it compares to all keys via dot product to get raw scores, then scales them (divide by sqrt of key size) to stabilize training. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMHkbXzHn7s)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing Attention\n",
    "Softmax turns scores into probabilities (weights summing to 1), then multiplies by values for a weighted output mix. This creates context-rich representations where important distant words contribute more. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/transformer-attention-mechanism-in-nlp/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "Instead of one attention pass, split into multiple \"heads\" (e.g., 8-16), each learning different relationships—like syntax in one head, semantics in another. Outputs concatenate and project linearly for richer context. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvZS6PDUtD4)"
